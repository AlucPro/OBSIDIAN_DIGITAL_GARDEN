  
The reason was that I didn't want to install Obsidian's sync backup plugin, so I decided to write my own. 

The principle is simple: use `crontab` to set up a local scheduled task that executes my script `run.sh`. 

Finally, I created this small tool called [cron-runner](https://github.com/alucPro/cron-runner). It provides a framework for scheduled tasks, including automatic script path setup, generating and viewing execution logs, and supporting custom shell & Node.js scripts.
